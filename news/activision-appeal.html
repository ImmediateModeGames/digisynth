                <p>

                    With Gamepass and buying entire publishers, Microsoft has positioned itself as a disruptive force in the video game console market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In another chapter in the still developing story regarding Microsoft's bid to purchase Activision Blizzard to bolster their gaming portfolio for a staggering $68.7, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)'s appeal to put a pause on the deal has been rejected by the Ninth Circuit of Appeals.
                     This as Microsoft is also reported to be in talks with the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to strike a deal to allow the acquisition, including possibly selling off a portion of its cloud-gaming rights to appease regulators. Many are weighing in on the decision with some approving and some bemoaning the decision. 
                     Microsoft Vice Chair and President, Brad Smith responded positively on Twitter to the news.  
                     <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We appreciate the Ninth Circuit&#39;s swift response denying the FTC&#39;s motion to further delay the Activision deal. This brings us another step closer to the finish line in this marathon of global regulatory reviews.</p>&mdash; Brad Smith (@BradSmi) <a href="https://twitter.com/BradSmi/status/1680005266878910465?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
                     Smith has been at the forefront of the push to get the deal approved and making the case on behalf of Microsoft publically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As long as this story has gone on it still hasn't been finalized.
                     Every time the deal appears to be reaching a final resolution something somewhat unexpected happens. 
                     From the very beginning there have been experts and analysts on both sides of the debate on the legality of the deal and whether regulators around the world would approve. One thing is certain, we have never seen a spectacle quite like this in the gaming or business world and there will no doubt be expos√©'s and books written on the drama in an industry that is usually rather predictable.
                    Microsoft increasingly seems to be of a disruptive force in the market, making it clear they want to offer consumers something different.
                     With the creation of Xbox Gamepass, tighter integration with the PC ecosystem, and mega-deals such as the purchase of Bethesda and Activision Blizzard intended to bolster its subscription and cloud-based services, it appears Microsoft is all-in on gaming, but intend to strike new paths and depart from the traditional console market mentality.
