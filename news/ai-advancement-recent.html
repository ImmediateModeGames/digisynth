                  <p>
                    Cameron Patrick  7/8/2023
                    <p>
                    In the past few years, the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed unprecedented growth and breakthroughs, revolutionizing various aspects of our lives. One such remarkable advancement is the development and progress of ChatGPT, an AI-powered language model created by OpenAI. ChatGPT, built upon the powerful GPT-3.5 architecture, has significantly pushed the boundaries of natural language understanding and generation, enabling more sophisticated and human-like interactions between machines and humans.
The opening you just read was actually written by a Large Language Model. 
</p>
The opening you‚Äôve just read was actually written by a Large Language Model. Could you tell? Like, did you know right away or even suspect that the opening was generated by a Large Language Model? The subject of the article may have tipped you off, after all. There are already a lot of people out there trying to immediately capitalize on this new seemingly rapid advancement recently and producing a lot of LLM generated content on the internet. To be clear the opening paragraph is the only part that will be generated by an LLM. From here on I, the feeling conscious human will be writing or rather typing this article üòÅ. This is a rough approximation of what we know as the Turing test. If you know. Which is a test of computing machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from a person. As of now, it is not considered completely passed by any machine or program, 
but many believe we‚Äôre getting close. This of course has many concerning prospects, people that have no interest or association with field are taking notice, and indeed the United States Congress has begun discussing and raising the issue more than often than they have in years. Artificial Intelligence is sometimes brought up in Congress in terms of funding research. May 2023 CEO of OpenAI, a major player in the field, testified before the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law on about issues of AI oversight. OpenAI also works with Microsoft in some areas, another huge player making significant advancements in the various disciplines related to Artificial Intelligence while also doing research. 
While there are obvious benefits and positive aspects of Artificial Intelligence and how it can improve people‚Äôs lives, we should also examine and discuss the potential pitfalls or harmful things that could, and some would argue are happening in a world of current level or significantly more advanced A.I. As image and video generations techniques and models become more advanced, deep-fakes are of more-and-more concern. Some observers have opined that bots on the internet can be generated and created more quickly than ever, and as the text they produce becomes more convincing, they could be used to sway public opinion. Governments or different groups in society could try and drum up support for policies this way. Basically, make it appear something that‚Äôs posted to a social media site a general positive public sentiment when it doesn‚Äôt, as well as many other tactics that could be employed. 
</p>
Look, I am very excited and optimistic about the future of this field and want research and advancement to continue. But we need to try and think about these things now and get ahead of it. It‚Äôs good that Congress is more focused on this area, but we‚Äôre in uncharted territory now, 
no one knows what pandora‚Äôs boxes we may open along the way. We can‚Äôt stop progress, but with a reasonably cautious approach, a clear plan, and little luck, let‚Äôs hope we can navigate the most difficult aspects of the questions and issues surrounding A.I. advancement.
